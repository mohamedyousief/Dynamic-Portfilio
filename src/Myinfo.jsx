Detailed Policy
➢ Policy Overview
The Group's vision is to lead with a strong entity with solid roots, building bright signs and being a beacon of goodness, a
source of pride for us and our generations. This is done by providing benefits and compensation, which are not limited
to salaries, but depend on the availability of non-material competitive advantages, which are a competitive advantage
for us in the local market, through internal programs that help the employee directly or indirectly for a better, easier and
quieter life, and this is through life insurance programs, health insurance, financial rent, employee support fund,
education support, your home in Mountain View, corporate offers and employee services.
➢ Total Reward Strategy Overview
The Central HR Total Reward Function is responsible for developing and maintaining competitive and sustainable
remuneration plans and programs to attract and retain key talent. The Total Reward Strategy aligns the Group's strategic
objectives, core beliefs, and values with its total rewards framework, emphasizing the pillars of Happiness, Loyalty,
Performance, and Potentiality. This strategy ensures a competitive and equitable remuneration system through
considerations of cost and budgetary constraints (via Annual Operating Plan budgeting), internal equity, and external
market competitiveness as informed by official annual salary surveys.
➢ Benchmarking
Our Total Reward Policy is underpinned by a rigorous, annual benchmarking process, ensuring that our compensation
practices remain both competitive and equitable. This approach is structured around distinct job families and market
data to accurately reflect the strategic value of each role within our organization.
The group leverages an official salary survey—with participation from over 300 Egyptian and international
companies—to benchmark competitive wages and benefits across various job grades. Additionally, the Total
Reward team performs biannual financial analyses in March and September to identify internal and external wage
gaps, which then inform salary adjustments based on performance and Compa-ratio.
1.1. Grades up to S3: Compensation is positioned at the market median, establishing a competitive baseline.
1.2. M Bands: Roles are benchmarked at the 65th percentile, balancing competitive pay with fiscal responsibility.
1.3. E Band and Above: Compensation is set at the 75th percentile, recognizing the strategic importance and higher
market demand for these positions.
1.4. Benchmarking Process:Policy & Process Document

Conducted annually and based on comprehensive job family analyses to ensure ongoing market alignment.
1.4.1. Salary Scales: Determined per job family, salary scales range between 70% and 130% of the target Compa
ratio, ensuring alignment with internal benchmarks and external market conditions.
1.4.2. Benchmarking outcome is used throughout the year in Hiring, or any Salary adjustments.
➢ Hiring:
When determining salaries for new appointments, our policy is designed to ensure that compensation offers are both
competitive and aligned with our internal standards. This determination is based on a careful evaluation of the following
factors:
1.5. Relevant Years of Experience: Assessing the candidate's work history to appropriately position their salary.
1.6. Internal Pay Scales: Ensuring adherence to established pay scales to maintain consistency.
1.7. Internal Equity: Guaranteeing fairness by aligning offers with existing internal peers.
1.8. Job Family: Classifying the role within the appropriate job family to ensure market and internal alignment.
1.9. Budget: Considering fiscal constraints to balance competitive compensation with financial sustainability according
to what was dialed in the AOP
1.10. Delegation of Authority: Talent Acquisition team can offer up to 80% Compa-Ratio while HRBP can approve
up to 100% Compa-Ratio, the CHRO can approve up to 130% Compa-Ratio. Above that limit Central Total Reward
approval must be obtained before offering.
This integrated approach supports our objective of attracting top talent while upholding a fair and balanced
compensation strategy.
➢ Salary Change due to promotion or internal transfer
When an employee gets promoted or transferred to a new job within the company, employees’ salary will be adjusted to be
fair compared to others and the market.
1.11. Rules
1.11.1. Target: Employees’ new salary should be around 70% of the typical pay for your new position.
1.11.2. High increase: If the employee needs a raise of more than 30% to reach that target, they’ll get it in over a
couple of raises (Salary plan), with 3 months between each raise.
1.11.3. Already paid Higher: If the employee is already earning more than 70% of the typical pay for your new job
and grade, they can get a raise of up to 10% not exceeding 130% Compa-ratio.Policy & Process Document

1.16. Eligibility Criteria
▪ Permanent full-time employees only

o Revenue
o Net profit
o Sales figures
▪ All metrics are calculated by comparing actual results to the Approved Annual Operating Plan (AOP)

The formula creates a direct relationship between company success and employee performance:

▪ Higher company profitability results in proportionally higher employee bonus

company-wide success. It applies to all employees of the company, provided that the employee has spent
